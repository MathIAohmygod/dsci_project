    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this report, the prompt being answered is \"We would like to know which 'kinds' of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\" To do this, we must analyse user behavior, which is the study of how people interact with a service, product, or interface. In this specific report, the aim is to determine how individuals interact with a particular game and how this data can be used to visualize and conceptualize a strategy for targeting these players for recruitment, whether that's for a different game, a research study, or another motivated campaign. To determine this, the two data sets that will be used are players.csv and sessions.csv.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, players.csv is a flat file containing 197 observations (rows) and 10 variables, providing individual records related to gaming or a similar digital service. The data describes an individual's personal information, including name, gender, age, played_hours, experience, subscription status, and an identifier email referred to as a hashed email. Furthermore, the analysis of players.csv must account for several potential data issues. The most notable issues are the missing data in some of the columns, which will make them unusable for segmentation. As well, there are categorical inconsistencies within the 'gender' variable, where the 'Prefer not to say' option should be treated as a non-response rather than a distinct demographical category. Furthermore, the played_hours should be checked for outliers or data entry errors. Beyond this, there are concerns about the unknown data collection methodology and the accuracy of self-reported fields, such as the experience of players. \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, sessions.csv is a log/event record. The data file describes the amount of time an individual will spend on the game in a timeframe, including start_time, end_time, original_start_time, and original_end_time. These are all linked to a specific hashed email, which serves as an identifier and also helps us link player performance (time spent on the game retrieved from sessions.csv) to player information (personal information from players.csv). As well, the dataset exhibits several data issues that must be addressed before analysis. Most notably, there is a redundancy in the time variables, and cleaning the data up would be beneficial in the analysis and answering of the prompt. Unseen issues also include the unknown data collection methodology and the lack of a unique session ID, making it difficult to guarantee the uniqueness of each log entry.\n",
