    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this report, the prompt being answered is **\"We would like to know which 'kinds' of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\"** \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To do this, we must analyse user behavior, which is the study of how people interact with a service, product, or interface. In this specific report, the aim is to determine how individuals interact with a particular game and how this data can be used to visualize and conceptualize a strategy for targeting these players for recruitment, whether that's for a different game, a research study, or another motivated campaign. To determine this, the dataset that will be used is players.csv. We will further specify the prompt to the question: **\"Can we predict the hours a player played using age, gender, and experience?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, players.csv is a flat file containing 196 observations (rows) and 9 variables, providing individual records related to gaming or a similar digital service. The data describes an individual's personal information, including name, gender, age, played_hours, experience, subscription status, and an identifier email referred to as a hashed email. We will only use the relevant variables 'played_hours', 'age', 'gender', and 'experience' to answer our question, and are described as followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Variable Name | Data type | Variable type | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| experience | object | ordinal | player's experience with Minecraft with 5 categories : Pro, Veteran, Regular, Amateur, Beginner|\n",
    "| played_hours | float | continuous | player's total playtime in hours |\n",
    "| gender | object | nominal | player's gender with 7 categories: 'Female', 'Male', 'Non-binary', 'Two-Spirited', 'Prefer not to say', 'Agender', 'Other'|\n",
    "| age | integer | discrete | player's age |\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, the analysis of players.csv must account for several potential data issues:\n",
    "* There is missing data in the columns 'individualID' and 'organizationName', which will make them unusable for segmentation and thus, dropped.\n",
    "* The 'gender' categorical variable has seven possible categories. There are very few observations for genders other than 'Male', 'Female' and 'Non-binary', so our model will not have enough data to accurately predict 'played_hours' for these genders. To avoid this, we will perform data analysis on only those three genders.\n",
    "* The exact data collection methodology is unknown, leading to possible inaccuracies.\n",
    "* With 'experience' variable, a self-reported field, there could be bias and inconsistency in the understanding of each category."

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In both figures, the largest bar occurs at age 15-20 for ~400 hours played. The second largest bar is at age 20-25 for ~350 hours played. The other age ranges contribute significantly less numbers of hours. This implies that the player age range 15-25 are more likely to contribute the largest amounts of data. One possible reason is that more of the players recorded are in that age range.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Figure 1, the largest bar has a significant majority of female players contributing to the number of hours. The second largest bar has a majority of hours played by non-binary players. Comparing the sizes of the largest two bars' colours, female players can be observed to contribute the most hours played.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Figure 2, the largest bar is composed of a majority of hours from amateur level players, followed very closely by regular level players. The second largest bar has a majority of hours from regulars and a significant portion of hours from amateurs. Comparing which experience contributes the most hours isn't accurate with this figure, but considering how close in hours both amateur and regular levels contribute, they should both be considered.\n",

    "Summary of what was found:\n",
    ">The core objective of the project was to determine whether a player's playtime could be predicted from their age, gender, and experience. The initial dataset comprised 196 player observations. Preprocessing involved dropping irrelevant identifying columns, standardizing numerical features, and mapping the categorical variables for experience and gender so that it would be a more usable format. To do the prediction task, the model used was K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor (K-NN). GridSearchCV was implemented to find the optimal number of neighbors (k) for the KNN model across the range of 1-20, and the RMSE was minimized through cross-validation.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Furthermore, the analysis revealed that the optimal number of neighbors (k) is 11, with an RMSE of 24.15 hours and an RMSPE of 38.94 hours. These are significant errors indicating that the model has very little predictive value, and that errors will be magnified for players with low actual played hours. Therefore, we conclude that the model is not suitable for accurately predicting individual playing hours.\n",
    " \n",
    "Discussion of the expectedness/unexpectedness:\n",
    "> From the visualizations (graphs), it was confirmed that high-played hours are correlated to age, experience, and gender, with the highest amount of played hours being from female amateur to regular level players with ages around 15-25. Something to keep in mind is the biases in self-reported experience levels, which might negatively impact the model's accuracy, particularly for KNN regression models.                                               >                              \n",
    "> Something unexpected was the predictive power of the model. Looking at the RMSPE and the RMSE, the numbers are extremely high, which points to the low predictive power of the model. This suggests that age, gender, and experience might not be primary drivers of sustained high play time. The played hours might have more correlation to unmeasured behavioral factors, such as in-game events, social network use, etc. Although it was expected that the variables provided would not provide a perfect predictive capability, it was not predicted that it would be as low as it was.\n",
    " \n",
    "Discussion of impacts and improvements that could be made:\n",
    "> Through looking at the visualizations, target demographics for high-volume data contribution can be determined. As aforementioned, there is a clear spike in the contribution of data from ages 15-25 from individuals of amateur-regular experience. A recruitment strategy should be catered to these individuals as they would be the most responsive.\n",
    ">                                                        \n",
    "> With regards to the model, there are some limitations to its predictive power from its reliance solely on age, gender, and experience. Through analysis, it is clear that while the current model can point to the right general groups that log the most gametime, it cannot accurately predict how much each individual plays. To improve this, it is suggested that more data should be collected with more variables so we can create a model with better predictive abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discussion of possible future questions:\n",
    "> Future explorations could be on questions of which additional variables could be used to better predict playtime or whether a non-linear or more complex model could improve prediction. Overall, while the model was not able to predict playtime accurately, the analysis revealed insights on data limitations and also highlights a potential direction for deeper, more informative future studies."
